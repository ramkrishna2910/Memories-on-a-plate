**Masala recipe:**
1. Grind a 4ish-inch piece of ginger, 6-8 cloves of garlic, and 3-4 Thai green chilies into a paste.
2. Heat oil in a pan and add the ginger-garlic-chili paste. Saute for 1 minute.
3. Finely chop 4-5 large red onions and add them to the pan. This is the most important step. Let the onions saute for about 30 minutes until they turn brown and into a paste-like consistency.
4. Blend 5-6 Roma tomatoes and add them to the pan. Let the water from the tomatoes boil off.
5. Add 2-3 teaspoons of red chili powder, 1/4 - 1/2 teaspoon of turmeric, 2-3 teaspoons of curry powder, 1 teaspoon of cumin, 1/2ish teaspoon of cardamom powder, and 1-2 teaspoon of garam masala. Cook the spices for a few minutes.
6. Add 12-15 cashews blended to a paste (this is important), followed by 2-3 cups of whole milk (no water).
7. Add 1/2 kg of paneer to the pan and cook to a thick gravy-like consistency.
8. Add salt to taste and smoke using coal and ghee.

**Rice recipe:**
1. Wash 4 cups of basmati rice in water until the water runs clear. This is an important step to remove excess starch.
2. In a large pot, add ghee and fry whole spices such as cinnamon, cloves, cardamom, maze, and star anise.
3. After frying, remove the spices and discard them.
4. Fill the pot with around 16 cups of water and add a lot of salt to saturate the water. Keep in mind that not all of the salt will be absorbed by the rice.
5. Add the washed rice to the pot and let it cook. After 8-10 minutes, as the water boils, you will see the rice bubbling to the top, indicating that the rice is about 80% cooked.
6. Filter the entire pot in a mesh to remove the excess water and then wash the rice in cold water. This stops further cooking of the rice and ensures that it is fluffy and separated.

**Layering:**
1. Add a layer of gravy at the bottom of a serving dish.
2. Add a layer of cooked rice on top of the gravy.
3. Sprinkle a layer of fried onions and coriander leaves over the rice.
4. Drizzle a few teaspoons of saffron milk blend over the onions and coriander leaves.
5. Repeat the layering process until the serving dish is full, with the final layer being a layer of gravy.
6. Optionally, garnish the top layer with additional fried onions and coriander leaves for added flavor and presentation.

**Dum:**
Close this entire pot and put it in the owen at 350F for 10-15 mins.
