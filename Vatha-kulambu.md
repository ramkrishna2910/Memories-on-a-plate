**Steps:**
Heat 1-2 tablespoons of sesame oil in a pan over medium heat until it shimmers.
Add 1 teaspoon each of mustard seeds, fenugreek seeds, and cumin seeds, along with a handful of curry leaves and 1 finely chopped shallot. Sauté for 1-2 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the shallot starts to brown.
Add 2-3 cloves of finely chopped garlic and 1-2 chopped tomatoes. Sauté for another 2-3 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the tomatoes are soft and the garlic is fragrant.
Add 1/2 teaspoon each of turmeric powder and sambar powder, and stir for 30 seconds to toast the spices.
Add 1-2 cups of [tamarind water](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YKO1Q3Fjzv4) (depending on how tangy you like it) and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 10-15 minutes, until the raw smell of the tamarind goes away and the mixture thickens slightly.
Add 1/2-1 cup of coconut milk (depending on how creamy you like it) and stir to combine. Turn off the heat and let it sit for a minute or two to let the flavors meld.
